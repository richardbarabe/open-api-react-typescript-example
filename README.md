This project is a basic example of using openapiTools/openapi-generator (npm version) to generate and use a typescript-fetch client from an openapi descriptor (see api.yaml at project root).

Client code will be generated when starting or building the application.

The generation is made in three steps (see generate-client.sh) :
- Use the npm library '@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli' to generate the client in a 'generated-sources/openapi' directory.
- Copy generated sources (generated-source/openapi/src) to src/generated/userapi so our code can import it without making typescript whine about importing a module outside of src folder.
- Delete folder previously generated by '@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli' (generated-source).

To start the application : 
`yarn start`

To delete all generated code : 
`yarn run clean`

To only generate the client code without starting the project : 
`yarn run generate-client`

Generated code is ignored in git (see .gitignore)

By default, it will try to connect to 'http://example.com/api/users'.  
You can change this by editing src/UserApiConfiguration.ts (see parameter named 'basePath')
