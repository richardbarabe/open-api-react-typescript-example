This project is a basic example of using openapiTools/openapi-generator (npm version) to generate and use a typescript-fetch client from an openapi descriptor (see api.yaml at project root).

When starting the application with :
`yarn start`

Here is the steps that are executed :
- Use of the npm library '@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli' to generate the client in a 'generated-sources/openapi' directory.
- Copy generated sources (generated-source/openapi/src) to src/generated/userapi so our code can import it without making typescript whine about importing a module outside of src folder.
- Delete folder previously generated by '@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli' (generated-source).

To delete all generated code : 
`yarn run clean`

To only generate the client code without starting the project : 
`yarn run generate-client`
